# Optimized-PPO-Research
**Project Title:** Enhancing Proximal Policy Optimization with Code-Level and OPPO+
Optimizations for Pathfinding in the Minigrid Environment.

## Project Phases
### Phase 0: Minigrid Setup
Basic minigrid implementation to ensure that the minigrid environment is functional
and has all required connections and functions in the env directory to allow for
successful testing in the later phases.

### Phase 1: Basic PPO
Basic PPO implementation in the minigrid environment for intial benchmarks.

### Phase 2: Code-Level Optimizations
Implements PPO with code-level optimizations in the MiniGrid environment to enhance
performance and efficiency for benchmarking.

### Phase 3: OPPO+ Algorithm
Implements OPPO+ algorithm in the MiniGrid environment to improve exploration for
improved benchmarking.

### Phase 4: Enhanced Code-Level Optimizations and OPPO+ Algorithm Merge
Enhanced Code-Level Optimizations and OPPO+ Algorithm Merge
Implements an advanced combination of Code-Level Optimizations for PPO with the
OPPO+ algorithm wihtin the MiniGrid environment, aiming to enhance the overall
benchmarking performance.
